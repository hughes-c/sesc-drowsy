### Output Options

printDetailedTrace              = 1   # Print Full Detailed Transactional Trace
printTransactionalReport        = 1   # Print Transactional Report (1 line per TX)
printTransactionalReportSummary = 1   # Print Transactional Summary Report
printSummaryReport              = 1   # Print Global TM Summary Report
traceToFile                     = 1   # Output debug info to a file instead of stdout
traceFile                       = ""  # Optional tag to add to the output file

### Coherence Protocol Options
# For Eager/Eager set the following to 1/1
# For Lazy/Lazy set the following to 0/0
# For Eager/Lazy set the following to 1/0

conflictDetect                  = 1   # Conflict Detection: 0 for lazy, 1 for eager
versioning                      = 1   # Version Management: 0 for lazy, 1 for eager

### Physical Cache Structure Options
cacheLineSize                   = 32  # Cache Line Size (in bytes) aka conflict granularity

### Stall Cycle Lengths
## Stall lengths are broken up into Primary/Secondary
## Primary is the longer delay (Abort on E/E, Commit on L/L and E/L)
## Secondary is the quick operation (Commit on E/E, Abort on L/L and E/L)
## Base is the static overhead in Cycles
## Var is additional stall cycles linearly dependent upon the write set

primaryBaseStallCycles          = 50  # Primary baseline stall (PBL)
primaryVarStallCycles           = 12  # Primary variable stall (PVL)
secondaryBaseStallCycles        = 12  # Secondary baseline stall (SBL)
secondaryVarStallCycles         = 0   # Secondary variable stall (SVL)

nackStallCycles                 = 1   # Number of cycles to stall after a Nack
abortExpBackoff                 = 4   # Exponential Backoff Time After an Abort (abortExpBackoff^abortCount)
abortLinBackoff                 = 0   # Linear Backoff Time after an abort (abortLinBackoff * abortCount)

### Randomization Factor
## A not great way to create some non-determinism by randomizing the cycle
## delays by adding to the delay time:
## (delay * (1+(rand()%applyRandomization)/100.0))
applyRandomization              = 0   # Randomization Factor


### Debugging Options
# These are advanced options that are unlikely to be needed by most (and even advanced) users.
# Some of them were carry-overs from the development phase of the TM/Assembly development
# itself, and have been untested for quite some time.

memDebugTrace                   = 0   # DEBUGGING Transactional Memory Tracing (inside of ops.m4)
calculateFullReadWriteSet       = 0   # Record and print global read/write set
limitAborts                     = 0   # Limit max number of aborts (for debugging, likely deprecated)
maxAborts                       = 1   # Maximum number of aborts (per thread)
tmDebugMode                     = 0   # Run in debug mode (don't actually preserve atomicity)
printRealBCTimes                = 0   # Print Coherence Module Begin/Commit Times
printAllNacks                   = 0   # Print Each NACK instead of only Begin/End NACK
recordTransMemRefs              = 0   # Create object for TM references
enableBeginTMStats              = 0   # Option to Delay calculation of TM stats
transReportFlush                = 1   # Number of Prints before FFlush


### Power Options
applySmartBackoff               = 0   # Use conflict probability to stall (yes/no)
